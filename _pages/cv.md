Course projects
============
* Investigating Many-to-many communication with and without piggybacking for Improved Network
Performance in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks
 (Course Instructor: Prof. C Siva Ram Murthy)
: Performance analysis will help in comparing different MAC protocols based on different VANET sce-
narios with and without piggybacking.
Studied various papers related to different MAC protocols and the simulations proved improvement
in network performance using M2M.
* Data Analytics contest
(Course Instructor:Prof. B Ravindran)
: To produce the best learning model given a large dataset of training data and compute its best possible
performance by testing out on a random test data supplied.
The model produced gave the second best result in the whole class missing first by a very narrow
margin.
* Dynamic Traffic Management System 
(BTech Project)
(Guide: Prof. Vijayanand.K)
: A mobile app that shows the optimised route based on the current traffic conditions

Teaching
======
* Half-time teaching assistant at Indian Institute of Technology, Madras
